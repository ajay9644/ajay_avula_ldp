# Demonstrating differences between class and functional components
React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offers two primary ways to create components: Class Components and Functional Components. While both serve the same purpose of encapsulating reusable UI elements, they have fundamental differences in their structure, syntax, and capabilities.

- Class Components:
  1. Syntax and Structure:
  - Class Components are defined using ES6 classes, extending from React.Component or React.PureComponent.
  - They contain a render() method which returns the UI elements to be rendered.
  - State and lifecycle methods like componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), etc., are defined within the class.
  2. State Management:
  - Class Components have their own state, initialized in the constructor using this.state.
  - State updates are performed using this.setState(), triggering re-renders when the state changes.
  - Complex state manipulation and management are easier due to the availability of lifecycle methods.
  3.  Lifecycle Methods:
  - Class Components have a rich set of lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), componentWillUnmount(), etc.
  - These methods allow developers to hook into different stages of a component's lifecycle, enabling actions like data fetching, state updates, and cleanup.
- Functional Components:
  1. Syntax and Structure:
  - Functional Components are defined as plain JavaScript functions that take props as input and return React elements.
  - They are simpler and more concise compared to Class Components, reducing boilerplate code.
  - With the introduction of React Hooks, Functional Components can now manage state and side effects.
  2.  State Management:
  - Functional Components traditionally lacked state management capabilities.
  - However, with the introduction of React Hooks (useState), Functional Components can now manage state without the need for classes.
  - useState allows for local state management within Functional Components, enhancing their flexibility and usefulness.
  3. Lifecycle Methods:
  - Prior to Hooks, Functional Components lacked lifecycle methods.
  - With Hooks, useEffect() provides functionality equivalent to componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount().
  - useEffect() enables developers to perform side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulations within Functional Components.
